### Problem Statement
In the car market, accurately determining the price of old cars is a complex and challenging task. 
Our objective is to develop a robust machine learning model using the Random Forest algorithm to predict the prices of old cars 
produced by a car company. This project involves comprehensive data preprocessing, advanced feature engineering, and model training to achieve
a high level of accuracy.
By developing this predictive pricing model,the project aims to enhance the car company's decision-making capabilities, enabling them to set competitive prices and
make informed business decisions based on historical data and market trends.
